## Course Info

CS188 introduces the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems with a specific emphasis on the statistical and decision-theoretic modeling paradigm. By the end of the course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in stochastic and in adversarial settings, drawn inferences in uncertain environments, optimized actions for arbitrary reward structures, and created machine learning algorithms.
